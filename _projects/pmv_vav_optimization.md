title: PMV-Based Air-Side Optimization for VAV Systems
description: We're developing a coordinated control scheme for AHUs and VAV boxes using PMV as the feedback variable. The controller adjusts supply air temperature, pressure, and zone-level dampers/reheat to keep occupants comfortable while cutting cooling and fan energy in office and retail buildings.
