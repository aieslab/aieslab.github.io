title: PMV-Constrained Solar Pre-Cooling Control in Retail Buildings
description: In large retail sites with rooftop solar, pre-cooling can reduce peak demand but risks discomfort. We're designing control logic that uses PMV as the comfort metric, pre-cools only when solar surplus is available, and limits grid demand during peak hours. This targets better comfort, better solar use, and lower grid stress.
