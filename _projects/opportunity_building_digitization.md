## What We're Doing

Every building deployment requires creating metadata—mapping sensors to equipment, tagging data points, defining relationships. We do this manually and it takes weeks. We want LLMs to automate it.

The pipeline would:
- Parse BIM files (IFC) and equipment schedules
- Extract entities and relationships from unstructured documents
- Map IoT sensors to physical equipment
- Build structured knowledge graphs
- Validate with human review

## Current State

Manual process for each site. We have templates and conventions, but no automation. Documents vary wildly in format and quality.

## What You'd Work On

- Develop LLM prompting strategies for building information extraction
- Build pipelines that process BIM, PDFs, and spreadsheets
- Design knowledge graph schemas for building systems
- Create validation workflows with human-in-the-loop correction
- Test on real building documentation

## Open Questions

- How do we handle the inconsistency in building documentation formats?
- What extraction accuracy is needed before human review becomes manageable?
- Can we learn transferable models across building types?

## Who We're Looking For

Someone with NLP and information extraction experience. Familiarity with knowledge graphs (Neo4j, RDF) is valuable. You don't need BIM expertise—we'll provide building context.
