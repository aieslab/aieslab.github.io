Reinforcement learning approach to optimize cooling system operation in data centers. Focuses on coordinating CRAC units, free cooling, and server workload distribution to minimize PUE while maintaining thermal safety.

## Approach

- Soft actor-critic (SAC) with safety constraints
- Digital twin environment for training
- Transfer learning across different facilities

## Results

- 15% reduction in cooling energy
- Improved thermal uniformity
- Safe deployment with fallback controls

**Collaboration:** Industry partner (confidential)
