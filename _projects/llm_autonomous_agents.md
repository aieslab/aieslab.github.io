title: LLM-Based Autonomous Agents for Facility Operations
description: We're exploring how LLMs can help with building operations by combining a building ontology (Haystack-style), real-time BMS data, and tool execution for diagnostics. The agent can answer questions, interpret sensor trends, look up manuals, and run simple checks. Deployments include ITE Singapore (NVIDIA stack), Central Pattana multi-property, and JW Marriott Bangkok.
