## What We're Doing

We have AI assistants deployed at several buildings—they answer questions, pull data, run diagnostics. But they're still assistants. We want autonomous agents that can operate buildings: monitoring overnight, catching anomalies, adjusting setpoints, scheduling maintenance, and escalating only when necessary.

The agent architecture includes:
- Building ontology (Haystack) for semantic understanding
- Real-time BMS data access
- Document retrieval (manuals, drawings, logs)
- Code execution for analysis
- Control actions (setpoint changes, equipment commands)

## Current State

Deployed at commercial offices, hotels, and multi-property retail portfolios in Southeast Asia. Current capability: conversational interface, data analysis, basic diagnostics. Target: autonomous 24/7 operation with human oversight.

## What You'd Work On

- Design agent architectures for reliable autonomous operation
- Build safety constraints and escalation protocols
- Develop evaluation frameworks for agent reliability
- Implement and test on live buildings
- Document failure modes and edge cases

## Open Questions

- How do we ensure safe autonomous control in critical building systems?
- What reasoning patterns enable reliable multi-step facility operations?
- How does the agent know when it's uncertain and should ask for help?
- What audit trails do we need for compliance and debugging?

## Who We're Looking For

Someone interested in autonomous systems and safety. Experience with LLM agents (LangChain, LangGraph) is useful. You should care about reliability—these systems run real buildings with real occupants.
