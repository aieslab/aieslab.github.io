title: AI-Driven Grid-Flexible Data Centre Control
description: Data centres usually run as inflexible loads. This project looks at how to coordinate IT workload scheduling with cooling operation so the site can respond to grid conditions without breaking thermal or SLA limits. We use RL and predictive models to test demand response strategies, peak shaving, and carbon-aware scheduling in simulation.
