title: Coordinated Air-Side and Water-Side Control in High-Rise Hotels
description: Large hotels have hundreds of FCUs running independently from the central chiller plant. We're developing a control architecture that links the two by predicting how much load flexibility exists across 441 rooms, feeding that into a plant-level MPC, and then mapping the results back to room-level setpoints. This lets the system treat cooling load as a controllable variable, improving overall efficiency.
