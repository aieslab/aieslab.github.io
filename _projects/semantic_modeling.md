Combining knowledge graphs with large language models to enable semantic interpretation of building systems. Knowledge graphs provide structured representation of building data and relationships, while LLMs enable natural language understanding and automated reasoning. This approach supports digital twin integration, automated interpretation of building data, intelligent control deployment, and natural language interfaces for building operations.

## Goals

- Automated discovery of control points
- Portable control strategies across buildings
- Integration with digital twin platforms

## Outputs

- Open-source Python toolkit
- Extended Brick Schema definitions
- Case studies from real buildings

**Status:** Toolkit in beta, accepting feedback
