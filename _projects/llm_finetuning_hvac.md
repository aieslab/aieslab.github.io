title: Fine-Tuning LLMs for HVAC Diagnostics and Building Operations
description: General LLMs don't understand HVAC systems well enough for operational use. We're creating a domain-specific dataset (12,000+ examples) and an 800-question benchmark that covers equipment behavior, control logic, and fault interpretation. Fine-tuned models are evaluated against this benchmark to measure real improvements over off-the-shelf LLMs.
