## What We're Doing

Data centres consume massive amounts of power but typically run as inflexible loads. This project explores how to coordinate IT workload scheduling with cooling operations so facilities can respond to grid conditions, enabling demand response, peak shaving, and carbon-aware computing.

The challenge is joint optimization:
- IT workload timing affects cooling demand
- Cooling constraints limit when workloads can run
- Grid signals change in real-time
- SLAs and thermal limits are hard constraints

## Current State

This is exploratory research building on our industrial cooling expertise. We're developing simulation environments and looking for collaborators to take this further.

## What You'd Work On

- Build simulation environments for data centre operations
- Design RL agents for joint workload-cooling optimization
- Implement grid signal integration
- Test demand response and carbon-aware strategies
- Collaborate with industry partners for validation

## Open Questions

- How do we model the coupling between IT workload and cooling demand?
- What RL architectures enable safe optimization under hard constraints?
- How much flexibility actually exists without violating SLAs?
- What's the real carbon reduction potential?

## Who We're Looking For

Someone interested in RL and energy systems. This is more research-stage than our other projects, good for someone who wants to explore and publish rather than deploy immediately.
