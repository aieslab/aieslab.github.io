## What We're Doing

Our AI agents need to reason about buildings—understanding that a VAV box is fed by an AHU, which is served by a chiller, and that a fault in one affects the others. Current tagging (Haystack) is too flat for this. We're exploring richer ontologies.

Areas of interest:
- Brick Schema for semantic relationships
- Graph databases for queryable knowledge
- Ontology patterns that support LLM reasoning
- Extensions for Southeast Asian building practices

## Current State

Using Project Haystack for basic tagging. Works for data organization but doesn't support the kind of reasoning we need for autonomous agents.

## What You'd Work On

- Evaluate Brick, Haystack, RealEstateCore for LLM compatibility
- Design schema extensions for our use cases
- Implement graph database architectures
- Build query interfaces for agent integration
- Contribute to open-source ontology standards

## Open Questions

- Which ontology patterns best support LLM reasoning about building systems?
- How do we represent temporal relationships (schedules, sequences)?
- What query patterns enable efficient multi-hop inference?

## Who We're Looking For

Someone with semantic web or knowledge engineering background. Experience with RDF, OWL, SPARQL, or graph databases. Interest in how structure affects AI reasoning.
