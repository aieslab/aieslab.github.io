## Overview

We develop advanced control systems for HVAC and industrial cooling applications using model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). Our work focuses on real-world deployments in buildings, data centers, and industrial facilities.

## What We're Working On

### Model Predictive Control for Chilled Water Plants

- Optimization-based control strategies for multi-chiller systems
- Energy efficiency improvements while maintaining comfort constraints
- Real-time implementation and testing on actual cooling plants

### Reinforcement Learning for HVAC Systems

- Data-driven control policies that learn from operational data
- Safe exploration and deployment in live systems
- Integration with existing building management systems

### Cooling Tower Optimization

- Advanced control strategies for cooling tower operations
- Weather-adaptive control and predictive optimization
- Energy and water consumption reduction

## Real-World Impact

Our control systems run on actual equipment in operational facilities, delivering measurable energy savings and improved system performance. We work closely with industry partners to ensure our research translates into practical solutions.

## Technologies & Methods

- **Control**: MPC, adaptive control, cascaded control systems
- **Machine Learning**: Reinforcement learning, neural networks, system identification
- **Optimization**: Convex optimization, mixed-integer programming
- **Tools**: Python, CVXPY, PyTorch, industrial SCADA systems

## Collaborations

We collaborate with industrial partners in the UK, EU, and Southeast Asia, providing access to real operational data and deployment opportunities for our students and researchers.
