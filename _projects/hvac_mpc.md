Development of model predictive control strategies for commercial building HVAC systems. This project focuses on hybrid approaches that combine physics-based thermal models with data-driven learning to optimize energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort.

## Key Features

- Real-time optimization with 15-minute prediction horizons
- Integration with building management systems (BMS)
- 20-30% energy savings in pilot deployments
- Robust constraint handling for comfort requirements

## Status

Active field deployment at two commercial buildings
