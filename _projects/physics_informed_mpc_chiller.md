title: Physics-Informed Model Predictive Control for Industrial Chiller Plants
description: We're building an MPC controller for chiller plants that combines simple physics-based performance models with data-driven cooling-load forecasts. The goal is to choose the best chiller staging, setpoints, and part-load distribution so the plant runs efficiently while still meeting cooling demand and equipment limits.
