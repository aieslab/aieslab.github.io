We're excited to announce the launch of the Autonomous and Intelligent Energy Systems Lab! Our mission is to develop advanced control and AI methods that make energy systems more efficient, sustainable, and reliable.

## Our Focus

The lab focuses on three key areas:

1. **HVAC and Industrial Cooling** - Developing model predictive control and reinforcement learning approaches for building systems
2. **Data Center Optimization** - Improving energy efficiency in data center cooling and operations
3. **Semantic Modelling** - Creating structured representations that enable automated control deployment

## What Makes Us Different

We're committed to bridging the gap between research and practice. Every method we develop is designed with real-world deployment in mind, tested on actual equipment, and validated with industry partners.
