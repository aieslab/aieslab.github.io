We're excited to share early results from our first model predictive control deployment in a commercial building.

## The Challenge

Traditional HVAC control relies on simple rules that don't adapt to changing conditions. This leads to energy waste and comfort issues.

## Our Approach

We developed a hybrid MPC system that combines:
- Physics-based thermal models for prediction
- Data-driven learning for disturbances
- Real-time optimization with comfort constraints

## Initial Results

After 4 weeks of operation:
- **25% reduction** in HVAC energy consumption
- Temperature maintained within **±0.5°C** of setpoint
- **15% peak demand** reduction during afternoon hours

## Next Steps

We're expanding the deployment to a second building and developing transfer learning approaches to reduce commissioning time.

Stay tuned for more updates!
