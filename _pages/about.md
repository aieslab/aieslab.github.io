The Autonomous and Intelligent Energy Systems Lab studies how advanced control methods and AI can improve energy efficiency and operational performance in real systems. Our work focuses on buildings, HVAC systems, industrial cooling, and data centres. We develop and evaluate control approaches such as reinforcement learning, model predictive control, and physics-based modelling to understand how these systems behave and how they can be operated more effectively.

## Research Areas

**Industrial Cooling and HVAC Optimization**

Control and optimisation of chilled-water plants, cooling towers, and HVAC systems, with an emphasis on hybrid and physics-guided approaches for efficient operation.

**Semantic and AI-Based Tools for Energy Systems**

Semantic models, structured data representations, and AI tools that make energy systems easier to understand, integrate, and operate.

**Data Centres and Grid-Interactive Operation**

Control and optimisation of data-centre cooling and related energy use, with interest in how these facilities can interact with and support future low-carbon grids.

## Current Work

- Autonomous control strategies for HVAC and industrial cooling
- RL/MPC methods for complex building and energy systems
- Semantic models and interpretable data structures for energy operations
- Digital-twin-based evaluation of control policies
- Energy-efficient operation of data centres

## Collaborations

The lab collaborates with industry partners and academic institutions to validate research under real-world constraints and enable practical deployment of advanced control methods.

We work with organisations operating HVAC systems, industrial cooling facilities, and data centres to develop and test control approaches that address actual operational challenges. These collaborations ensure that research outputs are technically rigorous and suitable for adoption in production environments.

Academic partnerships focus on advancing control theory, AI methodologies, and semantic modelling for energy systems, with emphasis on methods that can be integrated into real operations.

If you are interested in collaboration, please get in touch.
