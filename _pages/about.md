## Welcome to the Autonomous and Intelligent Energy Systems Lab (AIES)

The Autonomous and Intelligent Energy Systems Lab studies how advanced control methods and AI can improve energy efficiency and operational performance in real systems. Our work focuses on buildings, HVAC systems, industrial cooling, and data centres. We develop and evaluate control approaches such as reinforcement learning, model predictive control, and physics-based modelling to understand how these systems behave and how they can be operated more effectively.

**Join us:** If you are interested in research opportunities at AIES, please visit our [Join](/join/) page or [contact us](#contact) directly.

## Research Areas

<!-- TODO: Implement carousel with navigation dots for research areas -->
<!-- Each slide should include an image and description -->

### Industrial Cooling and HVAC Optimization

Control and optimisation of chilled-water plants, cooling towers, and HVAC systems, with an emphasis on hybrid and physics-guided approaches for efficient operation.

### Semantic and AI-Based Tools for Energy Systems

Semantic models, structured data representations, and AI tools that make energy systems easier to understand, integrate, and operate.

### Data Centres and Grid-Interactive Operation

Control and optimisation of data-centre cooling and related energy use, with interest in how these facilities can interact with and support future low-carbon grids.
