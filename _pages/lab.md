## Lab Motivation

The Autonomous and Intelligent Energy Systems Lab was created to address a persistent gap in the field: many strong research ideas for building and energy-system optimisation never make it into real operations. New control and AI methods often remain within academic settings because they are difficult to integrate, validate, or maintain in practice.

## The Research-to-Industry Gap

Advanced control methods such as reinforcement learning and model predictive control have demonstrated potential for significant energy savings and operational improvements in controlled settings. However, deployment in real buildings, HVAC systems, and data centres remains limited.

This gap exists because:

- Research prototypes are often developed using simplified models or datasets that do not capture the full complexity of operational environments
- Integration with existing building management systems and operational workflows is non-trivial
- Validation under real constraints requires access to equipment, data, and domain expertise that are difficult to secure
- Methods that work well in simulation may fail when subjected to real disturbances, equipment limitations, and safety requirements

## Research Philosophy

Our work focuses on how advanced control and AI can be made reliable and practical enough for real buildings, HVAC systems, industrial cooling, and data centres. We study reinforcement learning, model predictive control, physics-based modelling, and supporting semantic tools to better understand these systems and enable more effective autonomous operation.

A central part of the lab's approach is working with realistic data and real equipment, often through collaboration with industry partners. This allows researchers to test ideas under real constraints and produce methods that are both technically rigorous and suitable for adoption in production environments.

## Research Focus

**Control Methods**

Model predictive control, reinforcement learning, and hybrid approaches that combine data-driven and physics-based models for buildings and energy systems.

**AI for Energy Systems**

Machine learning methods that improve energy efficiency, operational reliability, and grid integration for HVAC, industrial cooling, and data centres.

**Semantic Tools and Digital Twins**

Structured representations, ontologies, and digital-twin frameworks that make energy systems easier to model, integrate, and control autonomously.

**Practical Deployment**

Methods for integrating advanced control into real operations, including robustness to disturbances, interpretability for operators, and compatibility with existing infrastructure.
