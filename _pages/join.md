We build AI and control systems that run on real equipment, in real buildings, data centers, and industrial cooling plants. If you're a student or researcher who wants to learn from real systems, contribute to live industry pilots, and build portfolio-level work that actually matters, we'd love to work with you.

## What You'll Get

- **Real-world data and hardware**, not just simulations
- **Hands-on projects** that can become strong portfolio pieces
- **Industry collaborations** with companies in UK, EU, and Southeast Asia
- **Opportunities to co-author** papers, reports, or open-source tools
- **Experience working on problems** that have direct climate and energy impact
- **Mentorship** in AI, control, optimization, and energy systems

You'll build things that matter—and you'll learn faster than in a typical academic group.

## Research Topics

We're actively looking for students and researchers to work on these areas:
